<p>We apologise for returning this so late, but there were delays with the marking due to the strike and then due to the Covid-19 situation, which made returning these files to you much more difficult than usual.</p> <p>Because some of your fellow students have not yet submitted their coursework, due to mitigating circumstances, I would like to ask you to keep the marked coursework to yourself and to not share it with others. I hope you find the feedback useful and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.</p><br><p>Jo&atildeo</p>
