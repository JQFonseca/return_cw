# `return_cw.py` 

This is a programme for returning coursework downloaded in a batch from BB9. It uses the usernames in the filenames produced by BB9 and a file listing usernames and emails to return the file to the student via the University of Manchester exchange server.

## Installation
Just download and run. Better packaging will come when I learn how to do it.

## Usage
Clone or download the files and run `python return_cw.py'

## Requirements

Needs `tk` and `exchangelib`. 

Anaconda python provides tk and exchangeLib can be installed using pip:

`>python -m pip install exchangelib`
